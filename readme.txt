Help a Charity donation plugin


== Description ==

Help a Charity is a plugin where Woocommerce owners save a fixed amount per order in their store and after the target amount has been reached they give this amount to a charity of their choice.
This type of charity is not given from visitor but only from the Woocommerce owner. No amount is taken from the visitors.
The idea came across with the need of lv8 - consulting (<https://www.lv8.gr>) customers, to contribute for local fundraisers.
